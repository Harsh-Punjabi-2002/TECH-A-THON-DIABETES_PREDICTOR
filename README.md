# DIABETES_PREDICTOR
Our project can predict whether a person could be diagnosed with diabetes or not and how much percent are the chances of having diabetes.
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome.
Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age and so on. 
After using logistic regression, random forest classifier, KNN and support vector machine, the logistic regression gave the accuracy of 83%,
Hyperparameter tuning randomized Search CV, Libraries used in our project are NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, pickle, seaborn

# Tech Stack
* IDE: Jupyter notebook

# Data Set: 
The datasets consist of like the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age and so on

# Model Creation:
* Different types of models were tried like random forest, logistic regression,support vector machines, knn.
* Out of these logistic regression gave accuracy of 83%
