# TECH-A-THON-DIABETES_PREDICTOR

# Event Name:  TECH-A-THON

A mega beneficial event that got us involved in learning a lot, attending various webinars, and gave us the needed exposure to various technical fields. It is a 5-week long event and has 2 domains

1.	Embedded Systems/Core Electronics
2.	Machine Learning /AI

We chose Machine Learning /AI for our project 

# Theme: HEALTH AND SAFETY

# Project Name: DIABETES_PREDICTOR

“Stop Diabetes, before it starts”

# Why we chose this project?

1.  Today there is hardly any household where one or more people are not suffering from diabetes. It has become a common disease of every household.
2.  So we wanted to make a project that could aware people in the early stages or in the beginning so that they could take all precautions to control diabetes. It would make them health conscious.

# Project Purpose:

Our Project aims at building a machine learning model to accurately predict weather the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

**HOW IS THE PURPOSE ACHIEVED?**

The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable. Hence using all the data, libraries and testing all the permutation and combinations our predictor will give the accurate prediction whether a person have possibility of diabetes and with what percentage.

# About The Project:

Our project can predict whether a person could be diagnosed with diabetes or not and how much percentage are the chances of having diabetes. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age and so on. After using logistic regression, random forest classifier, KNN and support vector machine, the **logistic regression gave the accuracy of 83%**, Hyperparameter tuning **randomized Search CV**, Libraries used in our project are **NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, pickle, seaborn**.

# FEATURES OF PROJECT:

1.	The **project predicts the risk involved for a person to get diabetic.**
2.	Here, **logistic regression** is used to predict the data value based on prior observations of the data set.
3.	It is **interactive** and easy to use.

**USABILITY :**
           
1.	It detects whether a person is at risk of getting diabetes or not.
2.	Helps in knowing about the disease at early stages
3.	Quick treatment could initialize.
4.	Free and easily available to large number of people.

**Here is the screen shot of all the libraries used in making the model from Jupyter file.:**

**Tech Stack**
•	IDE: Jupyter notebook
•	Pycharm
•	VS Code

# Data Set:

1.	Datasets consist of the all the data like the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age and so on, which is used while running the project. The data set is stored in CSV file.
2.	The dataset was taken from the site : 
kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

# Model Creation:

1.	Different types of models were tried like random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines, knn.

2.	Out of all these logistic regression gave accuracy of 83%

# RUNNING THE MODEL:

After completion of the model and doing some changes we ,finally ran the model. The output would basically tell the probability by which the person is diabetic.

Here is a glimpse of our output:

# Improvements for better implementation:

After making the model we decided to **make a website** out of it that will **include information about diabetes and why there is need to be aware** about it along with the project page to **give it a more interactive look**

Here is the glimpse from it :
